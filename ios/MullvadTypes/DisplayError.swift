/// A protocol that adds a formal interface for all errors displayed in user interface.
///
/// This protocol is meant to be used in place of `LocalizedError` when producing a user friendly
/// error message that requires a deeper look at the underlying cause.
///
/// Note that `Logger.error(error: Error)` picks up `errorDescription`s when unrolling
/// the underlying error chain, hence it's better to keep error descriptions relatively concise,
/// explaining what happened but without telling why that happened.
